Gemini API quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to install our libraries and make your first Gemini API request.

Before you begin
You need a Gemini API key. If you don't already have one, you can get it for free in Google AI Studio.

Install the Google GenAI SDK
Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
Apps Script
Using Python 3.9+, install the google-genai package using the following pip command:


pip install -q -U google-genai
Make your first request
Here is an example that uses the generateContent method to send a request to the Gemini API using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

If you set your API key as the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, it will be picked up automatically by the client when using the Gemini API libraries. Otherwise you will need to pass your API key as an argument when initializing the client.

Note that all code samples in the Gemini API docs assume that you have set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY.

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
Apps Script
REST

from google import genai

# The client gets the API key from the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)
"Thinking" is on by default on many of our code samples
Many code samples on this site use the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, which has the "thinking" feature enabled by default to enhance response quality. You should be aware that this may increase response time and token usage. If you prioritize speed or wish to minimize costs, you can disable this feature by setting the thinking budget to zero, as shown in the examples below. For more details, see the thinking guide.

Note: Thinking is only available on Gemini 2.5 series models and can't be disabled on Gemini 2.5 Pro.
Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents="Explain how AI works in a few words",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=0) # Disables thinking
    ),
)
print(response.text)

Text generation

The Gemini API can generate text output from various inputs, including text, images, video, and audio, leveraging Gemini models.

Here's a basic example that takes a single text input:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents="How does AI work?"
)
print(response.text)

Thinking with Gemini 2.5
2.5 Flash and Pro models have "thinking" enabled by default to enhance quality, which may take longer to run and increase token usage.

When using 2.5 Flash, you can disable thinking by setting the thinking budget to zero.

For more details, see the thinking guide.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents="How does AI work?",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=0) # Disables thinking
    ),
)
print(response.text)
System instructions and other configurations
You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so, pass a GenerateContentConfig object.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        system_instruction="You are a cat. Your name is Neko."),
    contents="Hello there"
)

print(response.text)
The GenerateContentConfig object also lets you override default generation parameters, such as temperature.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=["Explain how AI works"],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        temperature=0.1
    )
)
print(response.text)
Refer to the GenerateContentConfig in our API reference for a complete list of configurable parameters and their descriptions.

Multimodal inputs
The Gemini API supports multimodal inputs, allowing you to combine text with media files. The following example demonstrates providing an image:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from PIL import Image
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

image = Image.open("/path/to/organ.png")
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[image, "Tell me about this instrument"]
)
print(response.text)
For alternative methods of providing images and more advanced image processing, see our image understanding guide. The API also supports document, video, and audio inputs and understanding.

Streaming responses
By default, the model returns a response only after the entire generation process is complete.

For more fluid interactions, use streaming to receive GenerateContentResponse instances incrementally as they're generated.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=["Explain how AI works"]
)
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text, end="")
Multi-turn conversations (Chat)
Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation history.

Note: Chat functionality is only implemented as part of the SDKs. Behind the scenes, it still uses the generateContent API. For multi-turn conversations, the full conversation history is sent to the model with each follow-up turn.
Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()
chat = client.chats.create(model="gemini-2.5-flash")

response = chat.send_message("I have 2 dogs in my house.")
print(response.text)

response = chat.send_message("How many paws are in my house?")
print(response.text)

for message in chat.get_history():
    print(f'role - {message.role}',end=": ")
    print(message.parts[0].text)
Streaming can also be used for multi-turn conversations.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
Apps Script

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()
chat = client.chats.create(model="gemini-2.5-flash")

response = chat.send_message_stream("I have 2 dogs in my house.")
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text, end="")

response = chat.send_message_stream("How many paws are in my house?")
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text, end="")

for message in chat.get_history():
    print(f'role - {message.role}', end=": ")
    print(message.parts[0].text)
