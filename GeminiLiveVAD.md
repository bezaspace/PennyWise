Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) allows the model to recognize when a person is speaking. This is essential for creating natural conversations, as it allows a user to interrupt the model at any time.

When VAD detects an interruption, the ongoing generation is canceled and discarded. Only the information already sent to the client is retained in the session history. The server then sends a BidiGenerateContentServerContent message to report the interruption.

The Gemini server then discards any pending function calls and sends a BidiGenerateContentServerContent message with the IDs of the canceled calls.

Python
JavaScript

async for response in session.receive():
    if response.server_content.interrupted is True:
        # The generation was interrupted

        # If realtime playback is implemented in your application,
        # you should stop playing audio and clear queued playback here.
Automatic VAD
By default, the model automatically performs VAD on a continuous audio input stream. VAD can be configured with the realtimeInputConfig.automaticActivityDetection field of the setup configuration.

When the audio stream is paused for more than a second (for example, because the user switched off the microphone), an audioStreamEnd event should be sent to flush any cached audio. The client can resume sending audio data at any time.

Python
JavaScript

# example audio file to try:
# URL = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/hello_are_you_there.pcm"
# !wget -q $URL -O sample.pcm
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
model = "gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview"

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        audio_bytes = Path("sample.pcm").read_bytes()

        await session.send_realtime_input(
            audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
        )

        # if stream gets paused, send:
        # await session.send_realtime_input(audio_stream_end=True)

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.text is not None:
                print(response.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
With send_realtime_input, the API will respond to audio automatically based on VAD. While send_client_content adds messages to the model context in order, send_realtime_input is optimized for responsiveness at the expense of deterministic ordering.

Automatic VAD configuration
For more control over the VAD activity, you can configure the following parameters. See API reference for more info.

Python
JavaScript

from google.genai import types

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {
        "automatic_activity_detection": {
            "disabled": False, # default
            "start_of_speech_sensitivity": types.StartSensitivity.START_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
            "end_of_speech_sensitivity": types.EndSensitivity.END_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
            "prefix_padding_ms": 20,
            "silence_duration_ms": 100,
        }
    }
}
Disable automatic VAD
Alternatively, the automatic VAD can be disabled by setting realtimeInputConfig.automaticActivityDetection.disabled to true in the setup message. In this configuration the client is responsible for detecting user speech and sending activityStart and activityEnd messages at the appropriate times. An audioStreamEnd isn't sent in this configuration. Instead, any interruption of the stream is marked by an activityEnd message.

Python
JavaScript

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {"automatic_activity_detection": {"disabled": True}},
}

async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
    # ...
    await session.send_realtime_input(activity_start=types.ActivityStart())
    await session.send_realtime_input(
        audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
    )
    await session.send_realtime_input(activity_end=types.ActivityEnd())
    # ...
